# Seeds N Scrap
### Projects Description
Seeds N Scrap was conceived as a tower defense game where players plant crops to fend off waves of mechanical bugs attacking their house. The gameplay involved cultivating and selling crops/towers to afford upgrades for stronger defenses. The project is either scraped or still in development, feel free to take apart game code and rework it.
